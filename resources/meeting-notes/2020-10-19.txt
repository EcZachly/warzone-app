Pre-meeting notes & ideas
- We should have some simple percentiles for our classes, then generate the names dynamically
    instead of being so hard-coded into the sql, this way we could also add descriptions too!
- I think we should start on the logged-in experience now
    - How do we limit the usernames that someone can mark as "theirs"?
